# 100_Days_To_Victory

This game was built after five days of in-class Python lessons and then over a weekend. 
It still needs a tournament mode and a shop plus items.

The main goal was trying to work out the main mechanics. It was also my first attempt at creating and importing Classes and information from other files, which often created trippy loops. Once I get a "completable" version of the game done, I'd be curious what it'd be like to go back and redo it, yet using potentially different Classes and arrangements. 

Being able to create this after five days of lessons was exhilirating! I couldn't put it away until the coding mission was completed.

Excited to see what the other languages will teach me!

Any feedback is welcome :)
