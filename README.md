# 100_Days_To_Victory

This game was built after five days of in-class Python lessons and then over a weekend. 
It still needs a tournament mode and a shop plus items.

The main goal was trying to work out the main mechanics. 

Being able to create this after five days of lessons was exhilirating! I couldn't put it away until the coding mission was completed.

Excited to see what the other languages will teach me!

Any feedback is welcome :)
